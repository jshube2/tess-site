        I always feel like I'm wasting my time if I'm not drawing or painting. I'm not quite sure why,
        and its really unsettling because I feel like it interferes with everything I do and
        it takes away enjoyment from other activities. I think its because I'm not at a point I'm happy with,
        even though I've definitely seen improvement over the months and I feel like I'm finally coming into my own.
        But even on days where I'm feeling low and not confident, I always try to do my best and get at least one
        picture done, because having a finished product is better than three unfinished sketches. On my good days
        it feels like pushing myself on the bad days pay off because some things seem a lot easier. Anyway, I just
        wanted to post something here to get this started lol I think moving forward is one of the most important
        things to live by, even if its just a small step every day, you are farther than you were yesterday.
